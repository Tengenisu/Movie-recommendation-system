Sure! Here's a basic README.md template for your project that includes the use of cosine similarity for a movie recommendation system:

Movie Recommendation System
This project is a movie recommendation system that uses cosine similarity to suggest movies based on user preferences. The system processes movie data and compares it using cosine similarity to provide recommendations based on text-based features such as movie descriptions or genres.

Features
Recommends movies based on the similarity of movie features (e.g., genres, descriptions).
Uses cosine similarity to compute the closeness of movies to each other.
Handles user input with fuzzy matching to improve recommendation accuracy, even with slight errors.
Tech Stack
Python: Core programming language used for building the system.
pandas: For data handling and manipulation.
numpy: For numerical operations.
scikit-learn: For implementing cosine similarity and text vectorization.
rapidfuzz: For input matching and handling minor user errors.
How it Works
Data Handling: The movie dataset is loaded and processed using pandas.
Text Vectorization: Movie features (such as genres or descriptions) are converted into numerical form using CountVectorizer from scikit-learn.
Cosine Similarity: The similarity between movies is calculated using cosine_similarity to find the closest matches to a given movie.
Fuzzy Matching: User inputs are handled using rapidfuzz.process to allow for slight errors in movie names.
Installation
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/movie-recommendation-system.git
cd movie-recommendation-system
Set up the virtual environment:

bash
Copy code
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # For Mac/Linux
venv\Scripts\activate     # For Windows
Install the required dependencies:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
Run the main script:

bash
Copy code
python main.py
Input a movie: When prompted, enter a movie name. The system will recommend similar movies based on the calculated cosine similarity.
